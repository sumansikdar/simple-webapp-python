Conclusion

Define the Problem: Every call to an external microservice can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.
Explain the Need for Caching:
Reduce the number of calls to external services.
Improve response time for users.
Decrease load on the external services.
Benefits of Caching:
Improved performance.
Reduced latency.
Cost savings by reducing the number of API calls.

  Goals:
Efficiently cache API responses.
Use dynamic collection names.
Implement TTL (Time To Live) for cache invalidation.
Provide mechanisms for cache eviction.
