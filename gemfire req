Subject: Request for CHG Approval and Execution of RLMs for GemFire Prod Environment

Hi Vaithi, Muthu,

We are using GemFire for one of our services and need the production environment set up for the same. We have received the RLM details and require their execution to proceed with creating the GemFire production region.

We are planning this as part of the February off-cycle release. The execution of the production RLMs is a prerequisite for the GemFire team to create the Prod region. Once the region is ready and available, we can integrate it into our service in preparation for the March release.

Below are the RLM details:

rlm1
rlm2
We also need a CHG request for this activity. We can refer to the existing CHG request for the same.

Please let us know the next steps.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
[Your Team/Designation]
