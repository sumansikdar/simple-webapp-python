Subject: Request for Approval to Create a New GemFire Region

Hi Umesh,

I hope you're doing well.

Iâ€™m from the Oneview team, and we are currently working on integrating GemFire caching for one of our services. As part of this integration, we require a new region to be created under the assisted shared cluster CSI 169608 for our application.

Could you please provide your approval so that TenantOps can proceed with the region creation?

Let me know if you need any additional information.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
Oneview Team
