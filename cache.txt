I can understand. But my expectation is - we have a service(implemented in spring boot), that will call/consume another microservice and get the expected response in the JSON format. 
we have MONGO DB as a caching medium. Now tell me how to implement the caching layer here, Which should be able to cache the rest API response from microservices call in a 
best possible way/design so that we don't need to call the other services every time. We should have TTL defined, so that the MONGO DB as a cache can be updated accordingly. 
Here MONGO DB cache can store data into the mongo collections and documents for better implementation. Explain it with proper code implementation and project structure.


This setup provides a simple and effective caching layer using MongoDB to store REST API responses. The TTL logic ensures that stale data is not served, and fresh data is fetched 
from the external microservice when needed.


Thank you for the explanation. Here you have define the invalidation using TTL logic. But how the eviction logic will be implemented. and what all will be the condition check / 
parameter check to call that eviction algorithm. Please implement the eviction function / method also.

Collection Indexes
To optimize the performance, especially for eviction queries, create an index on the createdAt field:

db.cache.createIndex({ "createdAt": 1 })


cacheResponse(String id, String response) - Here the 'id' is the key to save the corresponding api response to the mongodb collection and same will be used to fetch the data from the db 
using getCachedResponse(id). What is the best way to implement the id here? please explain with code details

String cacheKey = HashUtil.sha256(id); - here what should be the id? It should be unique for each rest api call response. How to define it in the best way  possible ?

evictExpiredEntries() - if the TTL is a variable and will be supplied for each api cache. Then how can we implement the function more efficiently?

For generateKey() method if the api request is of type Post. Then how to handle it? 

For multiple collections let's say apiCache and dbCache, how the CacheDocument pojo classes will be implemented? And how to invoke them in CacheService class

=================================================================================================

1. Problem Statement
Start by clearly defining the problem that needs to be solved.

Example:

Title: Implement Caching for REST API Responses using MongoDB
Objective: To reduce the number of calls to an external microservice by caching responses in MongoDB, ensuring efficient retrieval and management with TTL (Time-to-Live) and eviction mechanisms.
2. Proposed Solution
Outline the proposed solution, explaining how it addresses the problem.

Example:

Solution: Implement a caching mechanism that stores API responses in MongoDB. Use TTL to invalidate cache entries and ensure fresh data retrieval. Implement separate caches for different types of data (API and DB responses) using a common interface and generic services.
3. Design Overview
Provide an overview of the design, including class diagrams and sequence diagrams.
