Sprint Story: Add Subfunction to DB Functionality
Subtask 1: Design the Subfunction
Objective: Define the requirements and design for the new subfunction.
Tasks:
Review the current DB functionality.
Identify the inputs, outputs, and behavior of the subfunction.
Document the design and get approval from stakeholders.
Subtask 2: Implement the Subfunction
Objective: Develop the subfunction based on the approved design.
Tasks:
Write the necessary code to implement the subfunction.
Ensure the code integrates with existing DB functionality.
Perform unit testing on the subfunction to ensure it works as expected.
Subtask 3: Integrate Subfunction with Existing System
Objective: Integrate the new subfunction with the existing system.
Tasks:
Modify the existing DB functionality to incorporate the new subfunction.
Ensure that all necessary dependencies are updated.
Perform integration testing to verify the subfunction works seamlessly with the existing system.
Subtask 4: Perform Code Review and Deployment
Objective: Review and deploy the subfunction to the production environment.
Tasks:
Conduct a peer code review to ensure quality and adherence to coding standards.
Address any feedback from the code review.
Deploy the subfunction to the production environment.
Monitor the deployment for any issues and perform post-deployment validation.
This structure should provide a clear roadmap for the team to execute the story efficiently.

Sprint Story: Add Subfunction to Eligibility API
Subtask 1: Analyze and Design the Subfunction
Objective: Understand the requirements for the new subfunction and design its implementation.
Tasks:
Review the current eligibility API specifications.
Identify the necessary inputs, outputs, and logic for the subfunction.
Create design documentation, including data flow and error handling.
Obtain approval for the design from relevant stakeholders.
Subtask 2: Develop the Subfunction
Objective: Implement the new subfunction within the eligibility API.
Tasks:
Write the code for the subfunction according to the design.
Ensure the subfunction is modular and can be reused if needed.
Write unit tests for the subfunction to ensure it behaves as expected.
Perform local testing to validate the subfunction’s correctness.
Subtask 3: Integrate and Test with the API
Objective: Integrate the subfunction with the existing eligibility API and conduct comprehensive testing.
Tasks:
Integrate the new subfunction into the eligibility API.
Update the API documentation to reflect the new subfunction.
Conduct integration testing to ensure the subfunction works correctly with the rest of the API.
Validate that the API’s overall functionality is unaffected by the new subfunction.
Subtask 4: Code Review, QA, and Deployment
Objective: Finalize the subfunction through code review, quality assurance, and deployment.
Tasks:
Submit the code for peer review and address any feedback.
Conduct QA testing, including edge cases and performance testing.
Prepare deployment scripts or configurations if necessary.
Deploy the updated API to the production environment and monitor for any issues.
This structure will help ensure that the subfunction is developed, tested, and deployed efficiently.
